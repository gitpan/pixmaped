CHANGES for Pixmaped

1999/02/15  Fixed a bug in pixmaped-xpm where colours which had names which
            included whitespace were not recognised and therefore converted to
            transparent. (Incidentally this was a problem with the
            ColourChooser dialog which has also been fixed.)

1999/02/17  Deleted a bit of non-working code that was supposed to change the
            cursor depending on context and put in working code throughout.
            Also found a tiny bug in ColourChooser which has been fixed:
            thanks to Jurgen Ibelgaufts for the sample xpm which uncovered it. 

1999/02/20  Added the ability to read xbm and gif images and write gif images.
            This has been achieved by using the GD library. (If you don't have
            GD the program will still run fine - you just won't have the extra
            functionality.) 

1999/02/21  Image resizing has now been implemented.

1999/02/22  * Added clean exit if you close any windows.
            * Stopped obsessively centering windows.
            -- Thanks to Jurgen for those.
            * Speeded up loading images. 
            * Can now draw by dragging the mouse - improves usability!
            * Added an icon - created using Pixmaped of course - how you get
              your window manager to recognise it is another matter...
            I've just bought the Emu book - it'll take me a while to get
            through, but hopefully the code will be improved and the
            outstanding functions implemented after that.

1999/02/23  Should now work properly with Windows.

1999/02/28  * X command line options e.g. -geometry now work.
            * Undo implemented.
            * Cut/Copy/Paste implemented.
            * Draw oval, rectangle and line implemented.
            * Draw filled rectangle implemented.
            * Help has now been fleshed out and is read from pod data.
            * Canvas now has scrollbars.
            * Faster and less memory-hungry than the alpha and beta versions.

1999/03/01  Added clipboard methods so that you can copy/paste between
            instances. Doesn't work though, so commented out.

1999/03/07  * Added postscript as a native output format.
            * Added support for Image::Magick.pm - if you have this you can now 
              read/write all the formats that Image::Magick.pm can read/write.
            * Made loading `appear' faster.
            * Grid outline can be switched on/off by Option/Show Outline menu option.
