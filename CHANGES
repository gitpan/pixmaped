Pixmaped

1999/02/15  Fixed a bug in pixmaped-xpm where colours which had names which
            included whitespace were not recognised and therefore converted to
            transparent. (Incidentally this was a problem with the
            ColourChooser dialog which has also been fixed.)

1999/02/17  Deleted a bit of non-working code that was supposed to change the
            cursor() depending on context and put in working code throughout.
            Also found a tiny bug in ColourChooser which has been fixed:
            thanks to Jurgen Ibelgaufts for the sample xpm which uncovered it. 

1999/02/20  Added the ability to read xbm and gif images and write gif images.
            This has been achieved by using the GD library. (If you don't have
            GD the program will still run fine - you just won't have the extra
            functionality.) 

1999/02/21  Image resizing has now been implemented.

1999/02/22  * Added clean exit if you close any windows.
            * Stopped obsessively centering windows.
            -- Thanks to Jurgen for those.
            * Speeded up loading images. 
            * Can now draw by dragging the mouse - improves usability!
            * Added an icon - created using Pixmaped of course - how you get
              your window manager to recognise it is another matter...
            I've just bought the Emu book - it'll take me a while to get
            through, but hopefully the code will be improved and the
            outstanding functions implemented after that.

1999/02/23  Should now work properly with Windows.

1999/02/28  * X command line options e.g. -geometry now work.
            * Undo implemented.
            * Cut/Copy/Paste implemented.
            * Draw oval, rectangle and line implemented.
            * Draw filled rectangle implemented.
            * Help has now been fleshed out and is read from pod data.
            * Canvas now has scrollbars.
            * Faster and less memory-hungry than the alpha and beta versions.

1999/03/01  Added clipboard methods so that you can copy/paste between
            instances. Doesn't work though, so commented out.

1999/03/07  * Added postscript as a native output format.
            * Added support for Image::Magick.pm - if you have this you can now 
              read/write all the formats that Image::Magick.pm can read/write.
            * Made loading `appear' faster.
            * Grid outline can be switched on/off by Option/Show Outline menu option.

1999/03/07  Very minor efficiency improvements.

1999/03/08  * Very minor tidying up.
            * Modified save of postscript: you now get a dialogue offering
              the choice of saving actual size or in the (magnified) size
              displayed. 

1999/03/09  * Moved Help menu to right. 
            * Added code to read .Xdefaults but it doesn't work - maybe this 
              is a Tk4 problem?
            * No longer distribute Tk::ColourChooser.pm and Tk::MesgBox.pm
              with Pixmaped.

1999/03/10  * Corrected cursor() lock so that cursor() changes work properly-ish.
            * Minor cosmetic changes.
            * Prefer Image::Magick over GD if user has both.

1999/03/13  * Another go at fixing cursor() lock... still not right though.
            * Fixed bug in rotate.

1999/03/16  Finally fixed cursor() lock... unless you can show otherwise.

1999/03/18  * Minor documentation changes to suit CPAN scripts area.
            * Appears to load a lot faster.

1999/03/19  Now prefer GD over Image::Magick if user has both - GD is faster.

1999/03/20  * After cut/copy we now correctly switch back to pencil tool.
            * Fixed cursor() lock (again).
		    * Added toggle option for whether tranparent is pasted over colour 
		      or not.
		    * Made file suffixes case insensitive (for Win32 users).
            * Added crude (recursive) but effective fill.
            * Added colour swap, i.e. swap one colour with another
              throughout the image.

1999/03/23  Reworked the toolbutton code - shorter and simpler now.

1999/04/21  * Added MesgBox.pm and (updated) ColourChooser.pm to .tar.gz.
            * After you change colour with a right click on a palette button,
              that button is automatically clicked for you.
            * Fixed help file so that you can read it more than once. (Also
              now use generic &render_pod routine from my tk-text library.)

1999/04/26  * Added Lupe Christophe's Makefile.PL, with minor changes. 
            * Made the default installation directory /opt/pixmaped (was
              /usr/lib/pixmaped).
            * Modified tk-text.pl and pixmaped-help.pod slightly.
            * Now use misc.pl for abs_path.

1999/08/05  Removed the Makefile.PL - couldn't make it do exactly what I 
            wanted.

1999/08/07  Minor fixes. Also Linux options file has been renamed
            .pixmaped to be more conventional.

1999/08/08  Changed licence to GPL.

1999/08/28  Eliminated spurious 'Deep recursion' warning.
            Its still dreadfully slow. I've tried changing some of the global
            variables so that there's less indirection but to no avail.
            Removed a bug in fill and swap colours that caused errors if the
            user clicked outside the image. 

1999/09/03  The colour under the cursor is not automatically shown on the
            status line - you have to middle click to see the colour now.
            (This is done for the sake of speed.) The whole application is
            faster (but still memory hungry, and still slow for anything
            bigger than icon-sized files).
