1. SYNOPSIS

Simple icon editor.

Pixmaped is a program for producing simple xpm files (pixmaps) and gif images,
for example icons. Although the gimp is available for sophisticated work,
for small (icon-sized) images Pixmaped should be a lot simpler to use.

Pixmaped works with X and Win32.

On-line help is provided - start up the program and click the Help menu option
or press F1. (Reading what's there will help!)

Pixmaped has full undo, and is mostly feature-complete. If you have
Image::Magick.pm Pixmaped will read/write all the formats that ImageMagick
supports.

See CHANGES for fixes and features.


2. REQUIREMENTS

Both these modules are required and are available from where you obtained
pixmaped: 
MesgBox.pm
ColourChooser.pm

Optional modules (from CPAN) it is highly recommended that you have one of
these, preferably Image::Magick:

GD.pm
Image::Magick.pm

Linux and X-Windows:
Perl 5.004
Tk 4 or 8 

Win32:
Perl 5.005
Tk 800.000

~250K disk space.


3. INSTALLATION

Note that Pixmaped can be installed pretty well anywhere - the only restriction
is that all the pixmaped* files must be together in the same directory.

# Create the directory.
mkdir /opt/pixmaped

# Copy the tar.gz to the opt directory.
cp pixmaped-VERSION.tar.gz /opt

# Change to the directory.
cd /opt

# Unpack the archive using method A or B:
# Method A for those using GNU tar
tar xvfz pixmaped-VERSION.tar.gz
# Method B for those not using GNU tar
gunzip pixmaped-VERSION.tar.gz
tar xvf pixmaped-VERSION.tar

# Change to the pixmaped directory.
cd pixmaped

# Rename main file.
mv pixmaped.in pixmaped

# This is optional. Make sure pixmaped is executable.
chmod +x pixmaped

# If this is an upgrade from a previous version and you're not using Win32
# then keep your options.
mv ~/.pixmaped-opts ~/.pixmapedrc

# This is optional. For Debian users only: if you want pixmaped to appear on
# your X menu do the following:
cp debian-menu /etc/menu/pixmaped
update-menus
# Note that the name of the file supplied, 'debian-menu', is changed in the
# move to 'pixmaped'. Note also that if you haven't used the paths given here you
# must change the command path in /etc/menu/pixmaped. The addition to the menu
# will only appear when the window manager is restarted.

# This is optional. To have the icon appear under X for icewm do this:
cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm/icons/
ln -s /opt/pixmaped/pixmaped-icon-16x16.xpm pixmaped_16x16.xpm
ln -s /opt/pixmaped/pixmaped-icon-16x16.xpm pixmaped_32x32.xpm
# and add the following line to /etc/X11/icewm/winoptions
pixmaped.icon: pixmaped

# To run Pixmaped from the command line:
/opt/pixmaped/pixmaped &

# You could always either alias this or use a soft link to a directory on the
# path to save typing the whole path. Note that 'deprecated' error messages
# which appear are harmless and can be ignored - these only occur under Tk 4.

5. NOTES

Pixmaped was developed because I found gimp too powerful and sophisticated for
my needs - I just wanted something quick and easy for knocking out small
images, e.g. icons and small gifs with transparency for web work.

The program was developed under Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 and 2.1.
