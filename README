1. SYNOPSIS

Pixmaped is a program for producing simple xpm files (pixmaps) and gif images,
for example icons. Although the gimp is available for sophisticated work, for
small images (less than 96 x 96 pixels x 94 colours) Pixmaped should be
a lot simpler to use. 

Pixmaped works with X and Win32.

On-line help is provided - start up the program and click the Help menu option
or press F1. (Reading what's there will help!)

Pixmaped has full undo, and is mostly feature-complete. It would be relatively
easy to add additional image transformations and additional file formats.


2. REQUIREMENTS

Linux and X-Windows at least:
Perl 5.004
Tk 400.202

Win32 at least:
Perl 5.005
Tk 800.000

200K disk space.

4. INSTALLATION

Note that Pixmaped can be installed pretty well anywhere - the only restriction
is that all the pixmaped* files must be together in the same directory.

# Create the directory.
mkdir /usr/lib/pixmaped

# Copy the tar.gz to the lib directory.
cp pixmaped-1.00.tar.gz /usr/lib

# Change to the lib directory.
cd /usr/lib

# Unpack the archive using method A or B:
# Method A for those using GNU tar
tar xvfz pixmaped-1.00.tar.gz
# Method B for those not using GNU tar
gunzip pixmaped-1.00.tar.gz
tar xvf pixmaped-1.00.tar

# Change to the pixmaped directory.
cd pixmaped

# This is optional since tar will set this up correctly.
# Move the library files into the Tk directory or any lib directory in Perl's
# %INC path that has a Tk subdirectory.
# (The -u option ensures we don't overwrite newer with older.)
mv -u Tk/ColourChooser.pm /usr/lib/perl5/Tk
mv -u Tk/MesgBox.pm /usr/lib/perl5/Tk

# This is optional. Make sure pixmaped is executable.
chmod +x pixmaped

# This is optional. For Debian users only: if you want pixmaped to appear on
# your X menu do the following:
cp debian-menu /etc/menu/pixmaped
update-menus
# Note that the name of the file supplied, 'debian-menu', is changed in the
# move to 'pixmaped'. Note also that if you haven't used the paths given here you
# must change the command path in /etc/menu/pixmaped. The addition to the menu
# will only appear when the window manager is restarted.

# This is optional. To have the icon appear under X for icewm do this:
cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm/icons/
ln -s /usr/lib/pixmaped/pixmaped-icon-16x16.xpm pixmaped_16x16.xpm
ln -s /usr/lib/pixmaped/pixmaped-icon-16x16.xpm pixmaped_32x32.xpm
# and add the following line to /etc/X11/icewm/winoptions
pixmaped.icon: pixmaped

# To run Pixmaped from the command line:
/usr/lib/pixmaped/pixmaped &

# You could always either alias this or use a soft link to a directory on the
# path to save typing the whole path. Note that 'deprecated' error messages
# which appear are harmless and can be ignored.


5. CHANGES

1999/02/15  Fixed a bug in pixmaped-xpm where colours which had names which
            included whitespace were not recognised and therefore converted to
            transparent. (Incidentally this was a problem with the
            ColourChooser dialog which has also been fixed.)

1999/02/17  Deleted a bit of non-working code that was supposed to change the
            cursor depending on context and put in working code throughout.
            Also found a tiny bug in ColourChooser which has been fixed:
            thanks to Jurgen Ibelgaufts for the sample xpm which uncovered it. 

1999/02/20  Added the ability to read xbm and gif images and write gif images.
            This has been achieved by using the GD library. (If you don't have
            GD the program will still run fine - you just won't have the extra
            functionality.) 

1999/02/21  Image resizing has now been implemented.

1999/02/22  * Added clean exit if you close any windows.
            * Stopped obsessively centering windows.
            -- Thanks to Jurgen for those.
            * Speeded up loading images. 
            * Can now draw by dragging the mouse - improves usability!
            * Added an icon - created using Pixmaped of course - how you get
              your window manager to recognise it is another matter...
            I've just bought the Emu book - it'll take me a while to get
            through, but hopefully the code will be improved and the
            outstanding functions implemented after that.

1999/02/23  Should now work properly with Windows.

1999/02/28  * X command line options e.g. -geometry now work.
            * Undo implemented.
            * Cut/Copy/Paste implemented.
            * Draw oval, rectangle and line implemented.
            * Draw filled rectangle implemented.
            * Help has now been fleshed out and is read from pod data.
            * Canvas now has scrollbars.
            * Faster and less memory-hungry than the alpha and beta versions.

7. NOTES

Pixmaped was developed because I found gimp too powerful and sophisticated for
my needs - I just wanted something quick and easy for knocking out small
images, e.g. icons and small gifs with transparency for web work.

The program was developed under Debian GNU/Linux 2.0.
