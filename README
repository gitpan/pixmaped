1. SYNOPSIS

Pixmaped is a program for producing simple xpm files (pixmaps) and gif images,
for example icons. Although the gimp is available for sophisticated work,
for small images Pixmaped should be a lot simpler to use.

Pixmaped works with X and Win32.

On-line help is provided - start up the program and click the Help menu option
or press F1. (Reading what's there will help!)

Pixmaped has full undo, and is mostly feature-complete. If you have
Image::Magick.pm Pixmaped will read/write all the formats that ImageMagick
supports.

2. REQUIREMENTS

Linux and X-Windows:
Perl 5.004
Tk 400.202

Win32:
Perl 5.005
Tk 800.000

~200K disk space.


3. INSTALLATION

Note that Pixmaped can be installed pretty well anywhere - the only restriction
is that all the pixmaped* files must be together in the same directory.

# Create the directory.
mkdir /usr/lib/pixmaped

# Copy the tar.gz to the lib directory.
cp pixmaped-1.10.tar.gz /usr/lib

# Change to the lib directory.
cd /usr/lib

# Unpack the archive using method A or B:
# Method A for those using GNU tar
tar xvfz pixmaped-1.10.tar.gz
# Method B for those not using GNU tar
gunzip pixmaped-1.10.tar.gz
tar xvf pixmaped-1.10.tar

# Change to the pixmaped directory.
cd pixmaped

# This is optional since tar will set this up correctly.
# Move the library files into the Tk directory or any lib directory in Perl's
# %INC path that has a Tk subdirectory.
# (The -u option ensures we don't overwrite newer with older.)
mv -u Tk/ColourChooser.pm /usr/lib/perl5/Tk
mv -u Tk/MesgBox.pm /usr/lib/perl5/Tk

# This is optional. Make sure pixmaped is executable.
chmod +x pixmaped

# This is optional. For Debian users only: if you want pixmaped to appear on
# your X menu do the following:
cp debian-menu /etc/menu/pixmaped
update-menus
# Note that the name of the file supplied, 'debian-menu', is changed in the
# move to 'pixmaped'. Note also that if you haven't used the paths given here you
# must change the command path in /etc/menu/pixmaped. The addition to the menu
# will only appear when the window manager is restarted.

# This is optional. To have the icon appear under X for icewm do this:
cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm/icons/
ln -s /usr/lib/pixmaped/pixmaped-icon-16x16.xpm pixmaped_16x16.xpm
ln -s /usr/lib/pixmaped/pixmaped-icon-16x16.xpm pixmaped_32x32.xpm
# and add the following line to /etc/X11/icewm/winoptions
pixmaped.icon: pixmaped

# To run Pixmaped from the command line:
/usr/lib/pixmaped/pixmaped &

# You could always either alias this or use a soft link to a directory on the
# path to save typing the whole path. Note that 'deprecated' error messages
# which appear are harmless and can be ignored.

5. NOTES

Pixmaped was developed because I found gimp too powerful and sophisticated for
my needs - I just wanted something quick and easy for knocking out small
images, e.g. icons and small gifs with transparency for web work.

The program was developed under Debian GNU/Linux 2.0.
