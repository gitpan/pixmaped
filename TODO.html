<H3>Pixmaped TODO</H3>

Note that Pixmaped is meant to be a quick and simple xpm editor (with the
ability to open and save gif files and open xbm files) that can be used by
people who don't need the power of the Gimp.<P>

Further development is unlikely. The basic architecture used won't stretch
much further - too much coupling - without significant work; and the value of
what could be added probably isn't worth it since if you go much further you
might as well use gimp.<P>

The biggest problem is that Pixmaped is far too slow, and I don't know how to
make it faster within the existing design...<P>

<UL>
<LI> Add missing functions:
    <UL>
    <LI> Text - right click to select font; click to type, click to place
    <LI> Filled Ellipse - I need an algorithm I can understand!
    <LI> Get the clipboard working so we can copy/paste between apps. The
    code's all there - it just doesn't work...
    </UL>
<LI> Now that we have <tt>Image::Magick.pm</tt> support we could of course 
now offer all the transformations that <tt>Image::Magic.pm</tt> offers.
<LI> Fix the focus bug where sometimes (always?) after &lt;Control-s&gt; to
save other keyboard actions cease to work (although the mouse works fine).
<LI> Add comment function which puts /*...*/ comments at the top of xpm 
files.
<LI> xpm hotspot editing and saving.
<LI> If you do File|Open before the grid has been created pixmaped will load
your file and *then* clear it with the new grid... Don't know how to
fix this one.
<LI> Write my own file dialog... or is Tk 800's better?
<LI> Make the PALETTE_ into an array and make read_opts and write_opts
cope with such arrays.
<LI> Extend the preferences dialogue. It should include the setting of the grid
background colour (transparent) and the grid outline colour and all other
option settings.
<LI> Use a separate dialogue for File/New offering height, width, grid colour,
outline colour, zoom (grid square size).
<LI> Add a second actual size image - this one tracking the image as edited so
the user can compare between the last saved (and revertable image) and the
current image.
<LI> The xpm module only copes with 1 char/pixel and up to 94 colours. It
would be nice to extend this - although for the images envisaged this is not a
problem.
<LI> Fix the numerous detail bugs in the use interface...
